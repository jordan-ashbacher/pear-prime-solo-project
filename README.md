# Pear

## Description

_Timeline: 2 Week Sprint_

Project Overview:
Pear is a full stack, mobile friendly application that helps eliminate the indecision around where to eat by matching your favorite restaurants with your friends' favorites. By integrating the Google Places API, users are able to set their current location and add restaurants to their favorites list by searching using names or keywords. 

A "more info" button give you a detailed information about that restaurant including the address, website, phone number and a handful of images. Once favorited, you're able to add and save notes about the food or experience for a quick reference next time they are looking to decide. 

The search feature also allows you to find and add your friends on Pear. From there, a simple button click to generate a list of matching restaurants based on your current location making it easy to view what places you have in common.
